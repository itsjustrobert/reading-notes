            Choosing A Text Editor
        </h1>
        <h2>
            A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on<br>
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that<br>
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write<br>
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most<br>
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

          The Command Line
      </h1>
      <h2>
        A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.<br>
         You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback<br>
          will be given to you similarly as text.<br>

        The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will<br> 
        be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

      <h2>
          Opening a terminal
      </h2>
      <ul>
          <li>If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. <br>
            An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight,<br>
             then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.</li>
          <li>If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. <br>
            Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.</li>
           <li>
                  If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client.<br>
                    A rather good one is Putty (free) .
