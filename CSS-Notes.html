<h2>CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."</h2>

  
     ex:   h1 {         
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}      
 <h2>for example you style this heading by identifying the element it and adding the attributes that you wish to style it with.</h2>
