            Operators!!! What are they?<br>
            Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.<br>
            In other words we can say that operators operate the operands.<br> In javascript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc.

        <ul>
            <li>
                +	Adds two numeric operands.
            </li>
            <li>
                -	Subtract right operand from left operand
            </li>
            <li>
                *	Multiply two numeric operands.
            </li>
            <li>
                /	Divide left operand by right operand.
            </li>
            <li>
                %	Modulus operator. Returns remainder of two operands.
            </li>
            <li>
                ++	Increment operator. Increase operand value by one.
            </li>
            <li>
                --	Decrement operator. Decrease value by one.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h1>
            Comparison Operators
        </h1>
        <h2>
            ==	Compares the equality of two operands without considering type.<br>
===	Compares equality of two operands with type.<br>
!=	Compares inequality of two operands.<br>
>	Checks whether left side value is greater than right side value. If yes then returns true otherwise false.<br>
<	Checks whether left operand is less than right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.<br>
>=	Checks whether left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.<br>
<=	Checks whether left operand is less than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.

        <h1>
            Logical Operators
        </h1>
        <h2>
            &&	&& is known as AND operator. It checks whether two operands are non-zero (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero), if yes then returns 1 otherwise 0.<br>
||	|| is known as OR operator. It checks whether any one of the two operands is non-zero (0, false, undefined, null or "" is considered as zero).<br>
!	! is known as NOT operator. It reverses the boolean result of the operand (or condition)

            loops?? What are they. Loops are functios to operate a bloc of for a certain amount of time
        </h1>
        <h2>
            two different types of loops
        </h2>
        <h3>
            For loop
        </h3>
        <h3>
            the for loop says :
            for(let i = 0; i > 5; i ++){console.log (i)}
        </h3>
        <h3> the while loop</h3>
        <h3>
            the while loop says

            let i = 5
            while(i > 30){
                console.log(i); i+3
            }
