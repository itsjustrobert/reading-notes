  Subheading 2: The learning Pit
  </h2>
  <p>
  Everyone everywhere when learning something new<br>
  will eventually hit a bottom where they feel confused<br>
  and they have to climb out of it by not giving up and keep learning.

  <h3> Subheading3: The 2 types of learning.</h3>
  <p> There are two types of learning one is <strong><em>PATH LEARNING</em></strong><br>
  With Path learning you are led and taught by someone<br> however the scope of your learning is totally dependent <br> on the path.<br>
  <strong><em> SANDBOX LEARNING </em></strong> on the other hand is where you are taught by experiencing what you learn<br> The beauty of it however is that you become an active contributor to your own learning.<br> These two types of learning, despite their obvious differences are critical in effective learning.
