        <h1> USING GITHUB TO MARKDOWN</h1>

        We use Github to markdown not only use it is an open source platform
        but it also offers different tools to use where you can have lttle or
        no experience with coding. The ease of use is incredible.
        
        <h2> MASTERING MARKDOWN</h2>
        
        Generally speaking, markdown is easy to learn as the rules aren't very difficult to grasp.
        There are limited _elements of style_ but not so limited that it takes away the integrity of the website and
        its basic functionality.
        
        <h2> GITHUB PAGES</h2>
        
        Github pages offer the user an easy to use way to render their document in a live browser, in which
        you can open the dev tools and see your work from another angle
        and can work from that angle to beautify your work or revise it completely
        
        <h2> GITHUB MARKDOWN SYNTAX</h2>
        
        Marking down with Github is basically the same as marking down with any code editor.
        Except for the little quirks and shades of differences.
        
        > FOR EXAMPLE<br>
        > in html you have to use open and close tags, but with basic markdown the language is a little less _bracketed_ <br>
        > to make a link one would have to use the h ref="url  /a tag <br>
        > but with markdown one simply has to use two pairs of brackets, namely: [],() <br>
        > this makes embedding a hyper link so much easier as you do not have to memorize much <br>
        
        > another example is how one makes emphasis in markdown vs html <br>
        > in html one would have to use <em></em> tag but with markdown all you have to do is put your <br>
        > targeted text between two _asterisks_ and you have emphasis. <br>
