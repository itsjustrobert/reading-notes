                Order of Execution
            </h1>
            <p>To find the source of an error, it helps to know how <br>
            scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; <br>
        some taks cannot complete until another task or fuction has been run.</p>

        <h1>Execution Contexts</h1>
        <p>
            The Javascript interpreter uses the concept of <strong>EXECUTION CONTEXTS</strong>. <br>
            Ther is one global execution context; plus, each function creates a new execution context. <br>
            They correspond to variables.
        </p>

        <h1>
            The Stack
        </h1>
        <p>
            The Javascript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. <br>
            When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks or piles <br>
            the new function on top of the current task.
